Primary Purpose: Evaluate the length of average movie times based on genre and rating systems. 
Secondary Purpose: Evaluate if there has been a change in movie lengths (general, by genre, by ratings) between 1980 to 2022.

What is the average length of a movie today and have movie lengths changed since 1940s?
  What is the average duration of a movie today? (movie lengths (mins on x-axis) vs. number of movies) (group into 3 bins short, average, long - can do box-plot) 
  Have movie lengths changed overtime? X-axis time (every 5 years since 1980) vs. movie length in minutes 


Do average movie times differ based on genre? 
  Currently there are x genres - Distribution of genres in movies (movies genres on x axis and # of movies on y - the most popular is X) 
  Movie genre by duration - (generes x-axis vs. minutes time) What movie genre has the longest duration/What movie genre has the shortest duration? (movie genres x axis vs. movie runtime - to identify the shortest and the longest) 
  Movie length changes overtime by genre (do the same trends hold?) 

Do average movie times differ based on movie rating systems (PG, PG-13, TV-14A, R)? 
  Does the age rating correlate with the length of the movie? (scatterplot with linear cor. Ratings on x-axis and length by minutes on y) 
  Age ratings by top 6 genres
