Project Title: You had me at, ‘Movies’,    Who’s up for a movie?

Team Members: Sunday Akiyesi, Benjamin Kidston, Kate (Xuan) Liu, Jane Enkhbaatar, Natasha Girdharry 

Project Outline: Who’s up for a good, old movie? During COVID-19 there was an increase in users for online streaming platforms including Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Crave (). 
This  predominantly occurred because stores and entertainment outside of the household was closed and individuals were working from home on a full-time basis. Oftentimes, 
during times of hardships individuals will turn to entertainment to cope with day to day life. While there was an increase in viewers streaming, was there also a change in movie preferences as well? 
This project will extract data to analyze trends in users' movie preferences before COVID-19 (2017-2019) and during COVID-19 (2020-2021). We will also assess whether preferences differed 
between age groups, genders, and different countries before and after COVID-19.
